### Bug reports:

- What is the actual behavior you see?

- What is the expected behavior?

- What are the *exact* steps to reproduce?  (Code samples please!)

**Remember: a bug report must have these three things!** Pointing in frustration at a zebra is *not* a bug report. It's just a zebra. 

However, if you say "I am looking at a ZEBRA" (1. actual). "I ordered a Palomino chestnut HORSE." (2. expected) "I put my quarter in the giant equine vending machine and selected the 'horse' option and a zebra popped out!" (3. steps to reproduce), then that's a valid bug report.
